# CVE-2024-51066: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in Phpgurukul Beauty Parlour Management System v1.1

## Description

An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in `appointment-detail.php` of Phpgurukul's Beauty Parlour Management System v1.1. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of other customers.

## Steps to Exploit (PoC)

To exploit the IDOR vulnerability in `appointment-detail.php`, an attacker can modify the `aptnumber` parameter in the URL to another value, granting unauthorized access to other customers' appointment details and exposing their Personally Identifiable Information (PII). This allows an attacker to iterate through valid `aptnumber` values to view sensitive data without proper authentication or authorization.

1. Access the `appointment-detail.php` page with a valid `aptnumber`.
2. Modify the `aptnumber` in the URL to a different value.
3. Observe that the application returns the appointment details of the customer associated with the modified `aptnumber`, demonstrating unauthorized access.
